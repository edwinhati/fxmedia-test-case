          Scrum is a lightweight, iterative and incremental framework for
          managing and completing complex projects. It was first introduced in
          the field of software development but has been adapted for use in
          other fields as well. The Scrum framework is based on a set of
          principles and values that promote teamwork, collaboration, and
          flexibility. The framework is composed of several roles, events, and
          artifacts that work together to help teams deliver high-quality
          products in a short amount of time.
          <br /><br />
          One of the key roles in Scrum is the Scrum Master, who is responsible
          for facilitating the Scrum process and removing any obstacles that may
          impede the team's progress. Another important role is the Product
          Owner, who represents the stakeholders and is responsible for defining
          and prioritizing the product backlog, which is a list of all the
          features and requirements for the product. Scrum teams work in
          sprints, which are short, time-boxed periods of time (usually 2-4
          weeks) during which a "potentially releasable" product increment is
          created. At the end of each sprint, the team holds a sprint review and
          retrospective to inspect and adapt the process, identify improvements
          and plan the next sprint.

          <br /><br />
          Scrum also uses daily stand-up meetings, called "Scrum meetings",
          where team members quickly share what they've done since the last
          meeting, what they're working on now, and any impediments they've
          encountered.Scrum also uses daily stand-up meetings, called "Scrum
